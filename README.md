# Selenium-Web-Automation-Sample
Basic Selenium based web automation implementation for filling a sample form contained in this repository. I've included the Chrome Driver exe file for Chrome 73. Try Downloading the driver according to your version of Chrome from the reference provided in this file.

P.S: Requires **Chrome Driver** to be installed manually.
Apart from that install packages from requirements.txt too.

# Quick Start:

You can use the virtual environment for running the project::

    $ pip install --upgrade virtualenv
    $ virtualenv env_name
    $ source env_name/bin/activate
    (env_name) $ pip install requirements.txt
    (env_name) $ python sample.py
